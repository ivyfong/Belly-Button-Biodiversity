# Belly Button Diversity

The objective of this project is to use Plotly and JavaScript to build an interactive dashboard to present data stored in a JSON file. The dataset contains information on microbes, also called operational taxonomic units or OTUs, found inside individuals' belly buttons. 

The information for an individual is displayed on the dashboard and is updated each time a new test subject ID number is selected in the dropdown menu. The individual's demographic information, top 10 OTUs, all OTUs, and belly button washing frequency are displayed in a text box, horizontal bar graph, bubble chart, and gauge chart, respectively.
